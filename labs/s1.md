  <summary>The Four Agile Values</summary>

The Agile Manifesto is built on four core values, emphasizing a preference for the first element when a conflict arises: 

- [ ] **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** Valuing people and how they work together more than the strict adherence to processes or specific tools.
- [ ] **Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Prioritizing the creation of functional software rather than spending excessive time on detailed, comprehensive documents.
- [ ] **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** Fostering continuous collaboration with the customer throughout the project, rather than solely relying on formal contracts.
- [ ] **Responding to change over following a plan:** Embracing changes and adapting to new requirements, even late in the development cycle, instead of rigidly sticking to an initial plan.

These principles elaborate on the four values, offering more specific guidance for agile teams: 

- [ ] **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery:** Prioritize customer satisfaction by delivering valuable software frequently and early.
- [ ] **Welcome changing requirements:** Be prepared to adapt to changes at any stage of development.
- [ ] **Deliver working software frequently:** Deliver functional software in short intervals (weeks rather than months).
- [ ] **Business and developers collaborate daily:** Foster close, daily cooperation between business stakeholders and the development team.
- [ ] **Motivated individuals, built around them:** Build projects around motivated individuals, trusting them to do the work.
- [ ] **Face-to-face communication:** Emphasize face-to-face conversations as the most effective form of communication.
- [ ] **Working software as primary measure of progress:** Progress is measured by the delivery of useful, working software.
- [ ] **Maintain a sustainable pace:** Promote sustainable development so that teams can maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- [ ] **Continuous attention to technical excellence:** Strive for high technical quality and good design to enhance agility.
- [ ] **Embrace simplicity:** Prioritize simplicity and maximize the amount of work not done.
- [ ] **Self-organizing teams:** Encourage self-organizing teams that can create their own best architectures, requirements, and designs.
- [ ] **Regularly reflect and adjust:** The team regularly reflects on its performance to become more effective and adjusts its behavior and processes accordingly.
