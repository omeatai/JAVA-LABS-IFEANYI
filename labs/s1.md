  <summary>The Four Agile Values</summary>

The Agile Manifesto is built on four core values, emphasizing a preference for the first element when a conflict arises: 

- [ ] **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:**
- [ ] Valuing people and how they work together more than the strict adherence to processes or specific tools.
- [ ] **Working software over comprehensive documentation:**
- [ ] Prioritizing the creation of functional software rather than spending excessive time on detailed, comprehensive documents.
- [ ] **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:**
- [ ] Fostering continuous collaboration with the customer throughout the project, rather than solely relying on formal contracts.
- [ ] **Responding to change over following a plan:**
- [ ] Embracing changes and adapting to new requirements, even late in the development cycle, instead of rigidly sticking to an initial plan.
